# Computational-Chemistry
This project demonstrates a C++-based molecular dynamics simulation using the Lennard-Jones potential to model atomic interactions. It initializes atoms randomly, computes forces, updates positions, and tracks energy over time â€” offering a simplified yet powerful insight into computational chemistry principles
